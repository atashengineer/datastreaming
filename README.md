# CDC with Debezium, Kafka, Postgres, and Docker 

## Overview

This Python script generates simulated financial transactions and inserts them into a PostgreSQL database, making it ideal for testing Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. Leveraging the faker library, it creates realistic yet fictional transaction data and populates a PostgreSQL table for a comprehensive test environment.
